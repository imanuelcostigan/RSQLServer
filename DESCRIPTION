Description: RSQLServer wraps the jTDS Project's JDBC 3.0 SQL Server
    driver and extends the RJDBC classes and DBI methods. It defines a
    SQLServerDriver, SQLServerConnection & SQLServerRsult S4 classes as
    extensions of the RJDBC equivalent classes. Most of the DBI methods will
    simply be calls to methods defined by RJDBC classes. However, the dbConnect
    and some of the dbGetInfo methods are specific to SQL Server. The jTDS
    drivers do extend to Sybase SQL Server, but currently, only Microsoft SQL
    Server is supported by this package.
